# KeyDown

[Keydown Live Link][keydown]

## Summary

KeyDown is a music-making application built with Anime.js and [wisDOM][wisdom], a JavaScript DOM Manipulation library that I created. KeyDown was made to serve as a live demo of wisDOM's functionality.

## How To Use KeyDown

Simply press any key on the keyboard. When a key is pressed, a sound is played, the key is displayed, and an animation is triggered on a quadrant of the screen. There are 40 sounds on KeyDown, and they can be triggered with the `0-9`, `a-z` `[`, `]`, `;`, `'`, `,`, `.`, and `/` keys. Have fun!
